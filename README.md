# Save to Git

A plugin for Glyphs.app that saves your font and commits the changes to a git repository.

## Usage

Instead of using the normal Save command, use `File > Save to Git`. This will save your file and commit the changes to the git repository the current file is part of.

## Known Issues

- The git command line utility must be installed on your system.
- The git repository must already be set up, and the Glyphs file must have been saved.
- The commit message just says "Updated ...", maybe more detailed change reports can be generated in the future.
- Set your own shortcut via system preferences.
